        <p>The mission of Knight Hacks is to promote creativity within the Computer Science and Engineering community by planning
          and executing “Hackathons”, which is defined as an event in which teams of developers, designers and project managers
          collaborate to produce a software or hardware product in a set amount of time. We also hold workshops throughout
          the year to give hands on experience with different technologies to attendees.

          <p>We'll be holding our second workshop this Friday and will be teaching everyone how to use `git`, a popular version
            control program, in the usual workshop fashion. If you're already comfortable with Git, don't worry. We'll have
            more interesting workshops coming around the corner, and we should have the finalized schedule posted soon! Feel
            free to spend your Friday night elsewhere if you're confident in your git skills. Or come by anyway and say hi!
            Up to you. </p>
